# From your Flutter project directory, run the following command:
    flutterfire configure

    - Running this command ensures that your Flutter app's Firebase configuration   is up-to-date and, for Crashlytics and Performance Monitoring on Android, adds the required Gradle plugins to your app.
# Once complete, rebuild your Flutter project:
    flutter run

   - You're all set! Your Flutter apps are registered and configured to use Firebase.
